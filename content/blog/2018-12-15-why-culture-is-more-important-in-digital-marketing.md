<p class="inner-blog-content mb-4 text-justify">Digital Marketing is not a tactic, it is an art amalgamated with a strategic approach. An effective digital marketing strategy considers the many facets before actually getting executed such as, demography, budget, buyers’ persona, expected results, etc. There is one more hidden gem that must be kept in mind by the digital marketing experts yet it is often overlooked. I am talking about the culture and cultural values of your target audience.</p>



<p class="text-justify darkbg-italic pl-5 pr-5 pt-4 pb-4 mb-4">"The culture is one of the most important factors that define the success or failure of a digital marketing campaign. Thus, when the digital marketing experts are creating the innovative paid ads or crafting the SEO friendly content to attract more loyal readers, at that time they need to define the buyer persona and during that process along with all other metrics, keeping the culture followed by the targeted buyers in consideration is really important. In fact, it often works as a deciding factor for the 8 out of 10 marketing campaigns."</P>


Let me give a real time example to understand the importance of taking culture into consideration while devising and executing a digital marketing plan:

**Recently in Iran, one T-shirt Company launched an ad in all forms of advertisements, including, traditional and digital. That ad talks about the “Freedom of Choice” for a woman, which is indeed a great message. However, that ad conveys a message that wearing short clothes depicts freedom of choice for women. As Iran is a Muslim country, this is against the religion, customs, beliefs and culture followed by millions of Muslim women over there. They cover themselves by choice often. Thus, even if the ad was conveying an absolutely right and effective message, it faced a lot of criticism and anger from people and audiences. As you can sense, the whole campaign might be good, but it failed disastrously just because it failed to understand and consider the culture of its target audience.**


There are many as such examples of highly creative and expensive, yet drastically failed ads just because of the fact that the creative team failed to understand a simple fact, i.e., the culture of the target audience.

<p class="inner-blog-content mb-4 text-justify">The great digital marketing creative professionals always research and understand the culture of their target audience and amalgamate their creative ad and its message to the culture in a way that touch the hearts of its target audience. These types of digital marketing campaigns that keep the culture and cultural values at the highest priority often get the most success and bring a lot of viral publicity and long lasting impact.</p>
