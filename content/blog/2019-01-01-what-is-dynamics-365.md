Microsoft has announced the upcoming availability of “Dynamics 365”. Set to be released this fall, Dynamics 365 promises to “turn business process into business advantage for organizations everywhere”.

**Dynamics is a combination of CRM and ERP:**

Dynamics 365 is a cloud-based ERP and CRM enterprise system. It was built by Microsoft for maximum flexibility and extensibility.

Microsoft already has significant plays in ERP and CRM. Dynamics 365 is the next step in the evolution of a combined ERP and CRM product.

**Dynamics 365 is in the Cloud:**

Microsoft’s increasing commitment to the cloud means that the availability of their new product is not a surprise. The cloud also allows Microsoft more control and standardization over the development of Dynamics 365, which is necessary given the common data model.

On-premises users can still go with Microsoft Dynamics GP or NAV; also, Dynamics 365, Enterprise Edition can be deployed on-premises if desired.

**Two Editions of Dynamics 365:**

**Dynamics 365, Enterprise Edition:**

The “Enterprise” version is going to be a newly developed combination of Microsoft Dynamics AX and Microsoft Dynamics CRM, and will be the higher-powered of the two offerings. Microsoft recommends Dynamics 365, Enterprise Edition for companies with more than 250 employees. It has six modules:

**1.	Finance & Operations:**
Previously known as Microsoft Dynamics AX, the operations module contains all of the finance and operations functionality of Dynamics AX.

**2.	Sales:**
This is the core functionality of Dynamics CRM, with all of the lead management and sales process functionality need as a salesperson.

**3.	Marketing:**
At launch, Microsoft announced a partnership with Adobe for the marketing portion of Dynamics 365, given their discontinuation of Microsoft Dynamics Marketing.

**4.	Customer Service**
The Customer Service module integrates CRM functionality, new functionality, existing Parature functionality, and more Microsoft partnerships.

**5.	Project Service :**
For project-based businesses, the Project Service module allows for the estimation and scheduling of projects in Dynamics 365. Great for professional services organizations! This module was previously available as a Dynamics CRM extension.

**6.	Field Service:**
For businesses with field agents or workers, this extra module leverages the mobility of the Microsoft cloud and delivers extra features these organizations will find handy. This module was also previously available as a Dynamics CRM extension.

**7.	Talent:**
The HCM module of Dynamics AX will be developed on its own track and can be purchased separately.

**8.	Retail:**
The Retail module of Dynamics AX will also be developed on its own track and can be purchased separately.

**Dynamics 365, Business Edition:**

The “Business” version of Dynamics 365 is the evolution of project Madeira, the cloud-based ERP/CRM. Microsoft recommends Dynamics 365, Business Edition for companies with somewhere between 10-250 employees. It has three modules:

**1.	Finance & Operations:**
The finance module is based on Microsoft Dynamics NAV. Some functionality has been removed, however-most notably manufacturing.

**2.	Sales:**
The sales module of Dynamics 365, Business Edition is based on Dynamics CRM and optimized for SMB customers.

**3.	Marketing:**
The Marketing module of Dynamics 365, Business edition is going to be released in spring 2017.
