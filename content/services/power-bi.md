content1= "<b> See, understand, and act on data. </b> Data Visualization is very often the first step in comprehending and communicating analytics because humans are much better at understanding data when it's presented graphically rather than numerically. When data is visualized, it's easier to see emerging trends, the very first step in deriving insight. Data visualization is also a powerful way to communicate a finding because the fast intuition possible supports easier collaboration and faster innovation. With ubiquity of data, data visualization technology is increasing in use and proliferating across multiple disciplines."
content2= "Data discovery is a term related to business intelligence technology. It is the process of collecting data from your various databases and silos , and consolidating it into a single source that can be easily and instantly evaluated. Data aggregation tools are used to combine data from multiple sources into one place, in order to derive new insights and discover new relationships and patterns—ideally without losing track of the source data and its lineage."
content3= "The benefits of dashboards and scorecards easily outweigh the costs associated with implementation. Both tools add real and immediate value to daily operations and managing performance. Easy and fast access to information for better decision making. Performance aligned with targets, goals and objectives. Customizable views for a variety of users. Enhanced analytical tools. Access to up-to-date information. Increased communication, prioritization and accountability."
content4= "<b>Translating consumer insights and big data into concrete initiatives that drive above-market growth.</b> A company’s ability to drive above-market growth hinges on the depth of its consumer insights and how well it translates those insights into effective action. To develop deep customer understanding, we employ a range of quantitative and qualitative marketing research approaches plus big data techniques that are both innovative and pragmatic. "
